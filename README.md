## About

Firebnb is an application that displays a list of spots. Users can sign in or create an account and view the details of a spot. Users can perform crud operations such as, create a spot, update a spot, delete a spot, and leave a review for a spot. My site is live on https://firebnb-project-f4vq.onrender.com

## Technologies

React/Redux CSS

I used React and Redux on the frontend for state management and to display the various pieces of information I obtained from the database. A PostgreSQL database is used on the live site in production, whereas a SQLite database is used in development. Furthermore, with CSS I was able to make media queries to ensure my site is responsive on different screen sizes.
